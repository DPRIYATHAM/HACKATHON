#I am from India, here many of us give more value to emotions and relations 
#nowadys I feel bad, as they are also getting decreased.
#people are running behind money and living values and morals.
#In this process they are loosing relations and not finding anyone who can support them are help in their sadness, share their happiness.
# I want to do this project with some basic knowledge of python.
